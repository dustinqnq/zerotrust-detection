Detecting unknown cyberattacks remains an open research problem and a signiicant challenge for the research community
and the security industry. This paper tackles the detection of unknown cybersecurity attacks in the Internet of Things
(IoT) and traditional networks by categorizing them into two types: entirely new classes of unknown attacks (type-A) and
unknown attacks within already known classes (type-B). To address this, we propose a novel multi-stage, multi-layer zero
trust architecture for an intrusion detection system (IDS), uniquely designed to handle these attack types. The architecture
employs a hybrid methodology that combines two supervised and one unsupervised learning stages in a funnel-like design,
signiicantly advancing current detection capabilities. A key innovation is the layered iltering mechanism, leveraging type-A
and type-B attack concepts to systematically classify traic as malicious unless proven otherwise. Using four benchmark
datasets, the proposed system demonstrates signiicant improvements in accuracy, recall, and error classiication rates for
unknown attacks, achieving an average accuracy and recall ranging between 88% and 95%. This work ofers a robust, scalable
framework for enhancing cybersecurity in diverse network environments.

1   Introduction
The tremendous advancement in information technology had signiicant efects on the current and future of
cybersecurity. The immense number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with unpatched security vulnerabilities
makes them susceptible to massive security attacks. Moreover, advancements in machine learning and artiicial
intelligence have been widely utilized in the cybersecurity domain, including but not limited to intrusion detection
system (IDS) solutions. With the large training datasets of modern traic, intelligent algorithms, and powerful
machine learning tools, security researchers have greatly improved the intrusion detection models and enhanced
their ability to detect malicious traic more accurately [17].
  Over the past year, there has been a signiicant surge in cyber threats that has raised alarm bells across the
cybersecurity community. Recent data from cyber security experts, Sonicware, reveals that in 2022 alone, there
were a staggering 2.8 billion malware attacks, averaging around 8,240 attempts per customer [22]. This surge
represents a signiicant increase from the previous year, where malware attacks hit a seven-year low in 2021. This
surge in malware activity can largely be attributed to the proliferation of cryptojacking and IoT attacks, which saw
increases of 30% and 77%, respectively, throughout the year. In fact, there were a total of 57 million IoT malware
attacks only in 2022. What’s even more concerning is that there were over 270,228 malware variants detected in
2022 that had never been seen before. This surge in newly developed attacks poses an eccentric challenge for
intrusion detection systems, including next-generation solutions. Further, the cybersecurity landscape of 2023
was profoundly impacted by a notable escalation in covert operations and the advanced capabilities of cyber
adversaries, as reported in the CrowdStrike 2024 Global Threat Report [1]. Remarkably, 75% of cyber attacks
were executed without the use of malware, indicating a substantial shift in tactics compared to the previous two
years. This evolution in cyber threat methodologies is attributed primarily to geopolitical tensions, underscoring
a strategic pivot towards more stealthy and sophisticated techniques of compromise.
  Unknown cyberattacks are becoming more prevalent than ever, consistently ranking as the second cause of
attacks for the past two years and the number one source of attacks in this decade [31]. Detecting unknown
attacks against computer networks and systems has been identiied as a challenging research problem by the
security research community [13]. Furthermore, unknown attacks constitute a signiicant percentage of the total
cybersecurity attacks ranking as the second top ten attacks. During 2022, the number of unknown attacks has
increased to 22.2% compared to 18.7% in 2021 [30], being second to malwares as the cause of cybersecurity attacks.
The lack of a standard scientiic deinition for unknown attacks and the inability of modern machine learning
models to detect all types of unknown attacks were identiied as two major issues.
  The research community has been relying on inconsistent deinitions for unknown attacks where unseen
instances of known classes (in the data science terminology) are often incorrectly referred to as unknown attacks
when used in testing models. The researchers addressed this issue in a previous study [5], where a proper
deinition for unknown attacks was proposed, evaluated, and validated. The proposed deinition distinguished
between "completely never seen before" attacks and referred to them as type-A unknown attacks and new
subtypes of "previously known" attacks and referred to those as type-B unknown attacks.
  Nonetheless, under the proposed deinition, researchers studied the ability of shallow and deep supervised
classiiers in detecting unknown attacks against traditional networks and IoT devices. It was concluded that the
classiication error rate of deep and shallow machine learning models is too high to be acceptable in detecting
various types of unknown attacks.
  In this study, the authors build upon previous studies [4ś6, 34] to solve the problem of detecting unknown
security attacks and propose a multi-stage multi-layer zero trust architecture. The performance of the proposed
architecture is then evaluated using four benchmarking datasets (i.e., CIC-IDS-2017 [38], CIC-IDS-2018 [39],
Bot-IoT [23], and IoT-23 [29]). The datasets were selected as two IoT datasets and two traditional network datasets.

  The proposed architecture distinguishes itself from prior works through its innovative multi-stage, multi-layer
zero trust approach tailored to address the challenges of unknown cyberattacks, categorized into type-A (entirely
new) and type-B (new within known classes). This architecture employs a hybrid methodology combining
both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques across multiple layers, thereby enhancing the detection
capabilities beyond what has been achieved in existing models. Speciically, it introduces a novel funneling
process where traic is subjected to multiple layers of scrutiny, signiicantly improving upon the precision, recall,
and error classiication rates for detecting unknown attacks, with results showing overall average accuracy and
recall between 88% and 95% across four benchmark datasets.
  This research not only advances the theoretical framework for intrusion detection systems (IDS) but also
demonstrates practical applicability across a range of network environments, including IoT devices and traditional
networks, ofering a more robust solution to the ever-evolving threat landscape. Four benchmarking datasets
(i.e., CIC-IDS-2017, CIC-IDS-2018, Bot-IoT, and IoT-23) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed
architecture. The key contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
    • Multi-stage multi-layer zero trust architecture: The paper introduces a novel architecture for an IDS. This
     architecture assumes all network traic is malicious by default unless proven otherwise, aligning with the
     zero-trust security model. It incorporates a multi-layer iltering funnel, allowing traic to pass through
     multiple ilters optimized to detect unknown attacks efectively.
    • Signiicant performance enhancement: Demonstrates signiicant accuracy improvements in detecting
     unknown attacks using four benchmark datasets.
    • Application across diverse network environments: The research extends the applicability of the proposed
     architecture to a wide range of network environments, including both traditional networks and IoT devices.
  The rest of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work on unknown attacks.
Section 3 presents the proposed architecture. This section irst presents the multi-stage multi-layer zero trust
architecture, then describes the datasets selection and processing steps. Section 4 highlights the evaluation
process and provides the performance analysis results. Next, Section 5 discusses the complexity analysis of the
proposed architecture, focusing on its space and time requirements, scalability, and performance in real-world
scenarios. Finally, the concluding remarks of the paper and the future work are outlined in Section 6.

2   Related Work
This section highlights the studies that aimed to address the issue of detecting modern unknown network
intrusions in the past few years, as well as several recently proposed novel anomaly-based intrusion detection
models.

2.1  Known Atacks
Ajjouri et al. [3] proposed a distributed hierarchical agent-based IDS architecture, utilizing case-based reasoning
to learn new patterns of security attacks from similarities with known attacks. However, without empirical or
formal evaluation, the efectiveness of this architecture remains unveriied. Sellami et al. [37] introduced a cloud,
agent, and anomaly-based IDS, pushing an agent to devices attempting to connect to a Cloud Service Provider.
This model, which triggers an anomaly event based on a predeined threshold, closely resembles traditional
agent-anomaly-based IDS but was presented without empirical validation. Khraisat et al. [20] developed a hybrid
two-layer model that combines signature-based IDS with anomaly-based IDS aimed at detecting both known and
unknown attacks, blending established and novel detection methodologies.
  Further, eforts to secure networks against known attacks are also a critical component of contemporary
cybersecurity strategies. The intelligent zero trust framework proposed by Guo et al. [16] for software deined
networking (SDN) integrates zero Ttust principles with the programmability of SDN to eiciently manage and

                                                                               ACM Trans. Priv. Sec.

mitigate known vulnerabilities and threats. This framework, along with the other discussed works, leverages the
lexibility and dynamic control ofered by modern network technologies to implement robust defenses against
identiied threats. By combining proactive measures against unknown attacks with strong protections against
known vulnerabilities, these research eforts contribute to the development of more secure and resilient network
environments.

2.2  Unknown Atacks
Kukiełka and Kotulski [24] presented a supervised learning-based IDS classiier to detect new attack types;
however, it requires retraining to recognize manually added new attack variants. Bao et al. [11] proposed a
general reasoning methodology to infer new attacks, lacking practical evaluation and a clear deinition of "new
attacks." Ahmad et al. [2] explored the eiciency of using ML algorithms (SVM, RF, ELM) on large datasets for
training IDS classiiers, suggesting that ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) is preferable for large data volumes.
Santikellur et al. [34] proposed a multi-layer network-based IDS, using machine learning models optimized
with evolutionary computing algorithms, yet did not evaluate the model’s performance against truly unknown
attacks. Qureshi et al. introduced both a Random Neural Network (RNN) classiier [43] and a hybrid model
combining RNN with the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) algorithm [33] for anomaly detection,
showing promising results in precision and accuracy.
  Meira et al. [27] conducted an experimental study into the detection of unknown attacks using unsupervised
learning techniques, inding that these algorithms often misclassiied attacks due to similarities with normal
traic. Amato et al. [9] explored the use of an Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classiier for identifying new attack
types without substantial experimental validation. Aljawarneh et al. [7] proposed a hybrid IDS using various
classiiers in a voting-based ensemble model, showing improved detection accuracy. Khare et al. [19] introduced a
hybrid model combining SMO algorithm with DNN, achieving signiicant improvements in detection rates. Tang
et al. [42] developed a deep learning IDS for SDN environments, demonstrating superior performance compared
to traditional classiiers.
  Kim et al. [21] and Jo et al. [18] explored image-based deep learning models for IDS, converting packet-based
datasets into image formats for evaluation. Bhavsar et al. [12] developed the PCC-CNN model, combining linear-
based feature extraction with CNNs, showing high detection accuracy. Sharma et al. [40] introduced a DNN
model for IoT networks, using GANs to address class imbalance, resulting in high accuracy. Xing et al. [45]
proposed DUA-IDS, a dynamic IDS for detecting unknown attacks, incorporating a feature extraction module that
combines a transformer encoder and CNN; while facing challenges with integrating detected unknown attack
categories.
  Moreover, the cutting-edge research in zero trust architecture (ZTA) and network security demonstrates a
signiicant emphasis on addressing unknown attacks; particularly through the use of advanced technologies such
as AI and ML. Sedjelmaci and Ansari’s framework [36] for 6G edge computing and Sharma et al.’s distributed
intrusion detection system for zero trust multi-access edge computing [41] highlight the move towards adaptive
security measures that dynamically respond to emerging threats. The use of AI and ML, as discussed by Yang
et al. [47] in the context of AutoML for zero-touch network security, further illustrates a focus on developing
systems capable of detecting and mitigating previously unseen attacks. These approaches embody the principle
of continuous veriication inherent to zero trust, aiming to protect networks against the constantly evolving
landscape of cyber threats.
  As discussed earlier, recent advancements in IDS highlight a shift towards methodologies that are not only
rigorously evaluated but also broad in their approach to detecting unknown threats, addressing past criticisms of
insuicient validation. The introduction of AI and ML-based solutions by Yang et al. [47] marks a signiicant step
forward in identifying new threats through adaptive learning. Similarly, the focus on empirical validation, as

seen in Sharma et al.’s [41] work on distributed intrusion detection for zero trust multi-access edge computing,
and the emphasis on adaptability in IDS, exempliied by Sedjelmaci and Ansari [36] in their study on ZTA for 6G
edge computing, underscore the importance of lexible and dynamic IDS solutions. This evolution towards more
validated, adaptable, and comprehensive security methodologies relects our motivation for creating more secure
and resilient network environments amidst the continuously evolving landscape of cyber threats.
  In conclusion, as evidenced in Table 1, a comprehensive review of the literature reveals that remarkable eforts
have been made to develop methodologies for detecting unknown attacks [9ś11, 18, 20, 26, 27, 34, 35, 42, 44, 46].
However, these approaches frequently sufer from shortcomings such as inadequate analytical rigor and evaluation
[9, 11] or an imprecise conceptualization of what constitutes an unknown attack [10, 26, 34, 44]. The persistent
absence of a deinitive solution underscores the critical need for continued research in this ield. To bridge this gap,
our study introduces a novel multi-stage Zero Trust IDS that innovatively integrates supervised and unsupervised
learning techniques within a funnel-like framework, speciically tailored to identify and mitigate both known
and unknown types of attacks.

3   Proposed Architecture
Focusing on the distinct characteristics of IoT and traditional network traic necessitates a deep understanding of
the inherent diferences between these environments, which directly impacts the development and performance
of intrusion detection systems. IoT environments are typically deined by a vast number of devices with limited
processing power and energy constraints, often communicating over wireless networks using speciic protocols

                                                                               ACM Trans. Priv. Sec.

like MQTT or CoAP, tailored for low power and bandwidth usage. This results in unique traic patterns, such
as periodic data transmissions from sensors or devices, and necessitates lightweight security solutions that are
eicient in processing and energy usage [8].
  On the other hand, traditional network environments, comprised of desktops, servers, and networking hardware,
handle more complex and higher-volume traic patterns, utilizing a broader range of protocols (e.g., HTTP, FTP,
SMTP). These environments can support more computationally intensive security measures and face a diferent
set of vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
  Thus, the proposed architecture in this paper is meticulously designed to address these variations, implementing
multi-stage, multi-layer detection strategies that adapt to the speciic requirements and constraints of each
environment. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and adopting a zero-trust security model,
the system efectively distinguishes between benign and malicious traic in both IoT and traditional networks,
ensuring high accuracy and recall rates. The proposed multi-stage multi-layer zero trust architecture for detecting
unknown security attacks is deined and detailed next.

3.1  Multi-stage Multi-layer Zero Trust Architecture
This subsection describes the proposed multi-stage multi-layer zero trust architecture for detecting unknown
attacks. Essentially, the proposed architecture assumes that all traic is malicious unless proven otherwise (named
zero trust). It acts as a multi-layer iltering funnel, where traic passes through multiple ilters designed to
root out all malicious traic using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms
logically organised to take advantage of the concept of type-A and type-B unknown attacks.
  In the heart of our proposed IDS architecture lies a sophisticated multi-stage, multi-layer zero trust model,
meticulously crafted to address the nuanced and evolving landscape of cyber threats in both IoT and traditional
network environments. Fig. 1 provides a visual representation of this architecture, illustrating its foundational
principles. The three stages of the proposed architecture are outlined as follows:
    • The irst stage consists of two layers of shallow deep learning classiiers designed to identify the primary
     type of attacks (i.e., type-A).
    • The second stage includes two layers of deep learning models designed to identify the subtype of attacks
     (i.e., type-B).
    • The third stage utilises an unsupervised clustering algorithm, namely DBSCAN [14], to distinguish benign
     from unknown traic.
  Two essential security principles were utilized in designing the proposed architecture: the Defense-in-Depth
principle and the Closed Security model. The Defense-in-Depth principle is a cornerstone of information security,
employing a multilayered approach to mitigate risks. Each layer is speciically tailored to address distinct threats.
Consequently, the proposed architecture is structured into three aforementioned stages, each incorporating
multiple ML layers, thereby demonstrating the defense-in-depth principle. The Closed Security model, on the
other hand, is based on the Deny-by-Default principle, where actions are denied implicitly unless explicitly
permitted. This model is implemented in the proposed architecture by assuming all network traic is malicious
until it successfully passes through all three stages. This approach embodies the zero-trust philosophy.
  At each stage, if all ML layers classify an instance as malicious, the processing halts, and the instance is
deinitively labeled as malicious. Conversely, if the instance is not unanimously classiied as malicious, it proceeds
to the next stage for further analysis. This staged approach is designed to optimize overall processing time while
simultaneously minimizing the false-positive rate.
  Further, the paradigm shift provided by the proposed architecture is operationalized through a funnel-like
process, where traic undergoes scrutiny across multiple layers, each designed with speciic ilters that leverage
a blend of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The initial layers employ shallow and deep learning

classiiers to sift through traic, segregating benign from malicious activities based on pre-deined characteristics
of known threats. Subsequently, an unsupervised learning stage employs clustering techniques to identify patterns
that deviate from the norm, lagging them as potential unknown threats.
  The hybrid combination between the supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms and the
hierarchical multi-layer design allows the architecture to identify benign, known, and unknown attacks with
notable recall and meagre classiication error rate. Theoretically, all known attacks should be captured in the irst
two stages. While the irst two stages are expected to catch some unknown attacks, the rest should be recognised
as noises by the unsupervised clustering algorithm.

  An integral part of our study involves the rigorous evaluation of our IDS architecture against unknown attack
types. This necessitates the creation of testing sets that accurately represent these unknown attacks; a process
for which we have drawn upon methodologies proposed in prior works, notably [5]. The creation of these testing
sets is pivotal to our research, as it allows for the simulation of real-world scenarios where an IDS must detect

novel attack patterns not present in the training data. The methodology involves categorizing attacks into two
types: type-A (entirely new attack classes) and type-B (new instances within known classes). For type-A attacks,
we remove all instances of a given attack category from the training dataset, ensuring that the system has no
prior knowledge of these attacks. These instances are then reintroduced in the testing phase to simulate the
scenario of encountering completely new attack vectors. Conversely, for type-B attacks, we exclude all instances
of a speciic attack subtype, following a similar rationale to ensure that the IDS faces genuinely unknown patterns
during testing.
  The dataset used for this procedure, delineated by Algorithm 1 in [5], undergoes a stratiied split to ensure a
balanced representation of various attack types, maintaining the integrity and challenge of the testing environment.
This methodological approach, adopted from [5], has been modiied in this study to adapt to the nuances of our
proposed IDS architecture and the speciic datasets employed. It underscores our commitment to evaluating our
system’s robustness in identifying and mitigating unknown cyber threats efectively.
  All instances of an attack category are removed from the training dataset and reintroduced in the testing
dataset to simulate type-A unknown attacks. Similarly, to simulate type-B unknown attacks, all instances of
an attack subcategory are deleted in a similar approach. ��� denotes the entire dataset, a speciic type of an
unknown attack is denoted by ����, which is a subset of ��� , and the combination of training/validation datasets
are both denoted by ��� − ����. �������� denotes a dataset which only contains benign instances.
  To clarify the process of simulating an unknown attack, the irst step involves identifying the class labels in
the dataset that represent attack categories (e.g., DoS). These class labels are referred to as type-A attacks. To
simulate a new category of unknown attack, all instances with the class label corresponding to DoS are removed
from the training and validation datasets and then reintroduced in the testing dataset. Therefore, the ML model
will have no prior knowledge of DoS attacks. Similarly, unknown attacks that are subtypes of known attacks are
simulated using a similar approach. In this case, the target is the class label representing a subcategory of attacks
(e.g., a UDP DoS attack). All instances in the dataset with the UDP DoS subclass are removed from the training
and validation datasets and subsequently reintroduced in the testing dataset, thereby simulating type-B unknown
attacks. Therefore, the ML model will have prior knowledge of other types of DoS attacks (e.g., TCP) but not
the UDP type. By iteratively applying this process to all classes and subclasses in the dataset, we successfully
simulated and evaluated the performance of the proposed architecture in detecting various types and subtypes of
unknown attacks, as deined by type-A and type-B unknown attacks. This approach enables the detection of
unknown attacks with varying levels of complexity. Unknown attacks that share common features with known
attacks are identiied in the irst two stages by being classiied as the most similar known attack. In contrast,
attacks that do not resemble any known attacks are addressed in the third stage. This process of simulating
unknown attacks establishes the foundation for evaluating the performance of deep learning models. Following
dataset preparation, the next step involves coniguring and optimizing these models for detailed analysis.
  Once the datasets are created, the deep learning models are conigured. In the literature, a shallow model
is an artiicial neural network (ANN) model with one or two hidden layers, whereas a deep model consists of
more than two hidden layers [28, 32]. Several studies have examined the efectiveness of deep learning models
in detecting cyberattacks within IDS [4, 13, 25, 32, 34]. In our implementation, a deep model consists of ive
hidden layers with ten neurons per layer, while a shallow model includes a single hidden layer with the same
number of neurons. In this context, the number of hidden layers is the only distinction between shallow and
deep models. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the efectiveness of shallow and deep models in
detecting unknown attacks under the proposed categorization [4ś6, 34]. The experiments were divided into two
main parts. The irst part focused on assessing the ability of shallow and deep multilayer feedforward ANN
models to detect type-A and type-B unknown attacks using binary and multiclass classiication. The second
part extended this evaluation to optimize the values for each hyperparameter. The indings generally showed
that ANN models outperform other ML models (i.e., SVM, NB and RF) in detecting cyberattacks and deep ANN

                                                                               ACM Trans. Priv. Sec.

models have been shown to outperform shallow ANN models in detecting unknown attacks but with notable
computational complexity. Therefore, they have been used for multiclass classiication, while shallow models
were reserved for binary classiication.
  After coniguring the deep learning models, clustering techniques are employed to enhance the architecture’s
ability to detect and classify patterns within the datasets. Among these techniques, the Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) stands out as a critical component of the proposed framework.
  DBSCAN [15] is a density-based clustering algorithm that groups n points into k clusters based on the
change of density between regions from high to low. DBSCAN requires two parameters, ������� and the
�������� �������������. Epsilon deines the radius around a point; while, minimum points deine the minimum
number of points within the epsilon. Unlike centre-based clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN does
not require the number of clusters to be known ahead of time and can distinguish noise points that do not belong
to any cluster making it suitable for the proposed architecture.
  A sensitivity analysis test is performed next to determine the best value for �������, given that the minimum
number of points is set to twice the number of features in the dataset. The results of the sensitivity analysis test
are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 2, which indicated that the best value for ������� is between 14 and 15 (it was
chosen to be 14.5) and that the minimum number of points is twice the number of features. The test was run
for more than 200 iterations, and with each iteration, the hyperparameters were increased until the value of
completeness stabilized. This was used to tune the hyperparameters of the DBSCAN model as shown in Table 3,
which shows the ������� value, number of clusters, number of noise points, completeness value, and the running
time in seconds.
  At the irst stage, the proposed architecture works by classifying each instance using two shallow deep learning
models, a binary classiier and a multiclass classiier. The binary classiier determines whether an instance is
benign or malicious, and the multiclass classiier identiies the known attack category. If both classiiers predict
the class as malicious, then the instance will be labeled as an attack of the predicted category. Otherwise, the
instance is passed to the next stage.
  At the second stage, the remaining instances from stage one are inspected by two deep ANN classiiers, a
binary classiier and a multiclass classiier. However, the multiclass model is trained to detect subtypes of known
attacks. Similar to the irst stage, when both models identify an instance as malicious, it will be labeled as an
attack with the predicted subtype. However, if either classiier identiies the instance as benign, then it will be
passed to the inal stage.
  At the third stage, the remaining instances are fed to the DBSCAN model, an unsupervised clustering algorithm
that does not require the number of clusters to be speciied. The model is trained using only benign traic along
with the data passed from the previous stages. At this stage, the instances which are clustered as noise points are
considered unknown attacks; otherwise, they are labeled as benign.
  The hyperparameter conigurations of the four deep learning models utilized in the proposed architecture are
detailed in Table 2. The rationale behind these conigurations, as well as the selection of speciic algorithms, is
thoroughly explored through experimentation and sensitivity analysis in [4ś6, 34]. In the proposed architecture,
an instance is classiied as benign only if at least one classiier at each stage identiies it as benign, thereby
adhering to the principles of zero trust. This means that if there is any doubt regarding the benign nature of an
instance, it will be treated as malicious and forwarded to the next inspection stage.

3.2  Dataset Selection and Preprocessing
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, four benchmarking datasets containing
modern realistic traic for IoT networks and traditional computer networks were selected (i.e., CIC-IDS-2017 [38],
CIC-IDS-2018 [39], Bot-IoT [23], and IoT-23 [29]). The datasets were primarily selected as two IoT datasets and

dataset, CIC-IDS-2018, underwent the same preprocessing steps. The CIC-IDS-2018 is a publicly available dataset
consisting of ten diferent CSV iles [39]. The dataset comprises 16,                                                    232,   943 instances, including 11,                     989,   837
unique instances, representing a signiicant enhancement over the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset.
    The dataset contains 79 standard features extracted from data corresponding to ten days of network traic
captured in PCAP format using CICFlowMeter. Two features contain missing values (i.e., Flow Byts/s and Flow
Pkts/s), where each feature has 95,760 missing values. Moreover, eight features were found empty (i.e., Bwd PSH
Flags, Bwd URG Flags, Fwd Byts/b Avg, Fwd Pkts/b Avg, Fwd Blk Rate Avg, Bwd Byts/b Avg, Bwd Pkts/b Avg,
and Bwd Blk Rate Avg). The 79 features were divided into 78 numerical features, one of which is a long number,
37 loating-point, 40 integers, and the remaining feature is a timestamp. Table 4 displays the statistical analysis of
the dataset.

    Originally, the dataset had a single multiclass label with six diferent attack categories constituting of 16.93% of
the total samples and one class for benign traic. Several preprocessing steps were taken to prepare the dataset.
First, two new labels were generated to indicate the binary class label and the attack category, which each CSV
ile represents. The existed multiclass label was used as the subtype attack label. After that, nine features were
eliminated: Timestamp, Bwd PSH Flags, Bwd URG Flags, Fwd Byts/b Avg, Fwd Pkts/b Avg, Fwd Blk Rate Avg,
Bwd Byts/b Avg, Bwd Pkts/b Avg, and Bwd Blk Rate Avg. Then, all the ten CSV iles were merged into a single ile,
and all repeated instances were removed, which reduced the dataset size by 26.14 times. Thereafter, the numerical

4   Performance Analysis
In this section, the results for evaluating the proposed architecture are presented and discussed for each dataset.
The results are presented per the general class type (i.e., benign, known, and unknown) and the overall performance
of the proposed architecture. Speciically, ive generalisation error metrics are used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed architecture, namely, the accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and classiication error rate. The
results are split into four subsections. Subsection 4.2 discusses the results of the unknown attacks, subsection 4.3
presents the results of the known instances, and subsection 4.4 presents the results for benign instances. Lastly in
subsection 4.5, the overall results of the proposed architecture are discussed.

4.1  Evaluation Metrics
In this paper, the following evaluation metrics are utilized to assess the performance of the proposed architecture:
    • Precision: Precision measures the proportion of correctly identiied positive instances out of all instances
     predicted as positive. It is calculated as:
                                            True Positives (TP)
                         Precision =                                                        (1)
                                   True Positives (TP) + False Positives (FP)
    • Recall (Sensitivity): Recall assesses the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identiied
     by the model. It is given by:
                                           True Positives (TP)
                         Recall =                                                           (2)
                                 True Positives (TP) + False Negatives (FN)
    • F1-Score: The F1-score provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing their trade-ofs. It is
     deined as:
                                              Precision · Recall
                                 F1-Score = 2 ·                                             (3)
                                              Precision + Recall
    • Accuracy: Accuracy relects the overall correctness of the model by measuring the proportion of correctly
     classiied instances (both positive and negative) to the total instances. The formula is:
                                   True Positives (TP) + True Negatives (TN)
                        Accuracy =                                                          (4)
                                              Total Instances
    • Classiication Error Rate: This metric calculates the proportion of incorrect predictions to the total
     number of predictions. It is expressed as:
                              Classiication Error Rate = 1 − Accuracy                       (5)

4.2  Unknown Type
In this subsection, the results of testing the proposed architecture on unknown data are presented and discussed
per dataset.
  When examining the proposed architecture performance in detecting unknown attacks using the IoT-23 dataset
shown in Table 8, the precision ranged between 0.00001 and 0.97 with a 0.15 average and a 0.28 standard deviation
with six outliers between 0.39 and 0.97. The recall ranged between 0.5 and 1.0 with an average of 0.86, a 0.11
standard deviation and no outliers. The accuracy ranged between 0.79 and 0.97 with an average of 0.88 and
a standard deviation of 0.06 with no outliers. The F1-score had a low average of 0.18, where the lowest value
was near zero (i.e., 0.0001), and the maximum value 0.97 with a 0.3 standard deviation and ive outliers ranged
between 0.64 and 0.97.
  The classiication error rate was interestingly low, with an average of 0.12 and a standard deviation of 0.06,
where the lowest value was 0.03 and the highest 0.21.
  The results of detecting unknown attacks using the Bot-IoT dataset were signiicantly more optimistic, as
shown in Table 9. The precision ranged between 0.08 and 0.96 with a 0.79 average and a 0.26 standard deviation
with a single outlier (i.e., 0.08). The recall ranged between 0.78 and 0.98 with an average of 0.93, a 0.04 standard
deviation and no outliers. The accuracy ranged between 0.86 and 0.98 with an average of 0.93 and a standard
deviation of 0.04 with no outliers. The F1-score had a single outlier at 0.15 with an average of 0.83, ranging
between 0.15 and 0.96. The classiication error rate had an average of 0.07 and a standard deviation of 0.04, where
the lowest value was 0.02 and the highest 0.14 without outliers.

attacks with a low number of instances such as the Heartbleed attack and Iniltration attacks. However, the recall
was extremely high in detecting such scarce type of attacks with a meagre classiication error rate. The results
showed that the precision was noticeably poor, ranging between 0.0004 and 0.91, with an average of 0.26 and a
standard deviation of 0.26 with no outliers. Subsequently, the F1-score was poor as well, with a 0.31 average, a
0.001 minimum value and a 0.91 maximum value, with a standard deviation of 0.34 and no outliers across all
metrics. Conversely, the recall was interestingly high, where it ranged between 0.86 and 0.97, with an average of
0.91 and a standard deviation of 0.04. Similarly, the classiication error rate results were good as well, where the
average was 0.10, and the lowest value was 0.04, and the highest value was 0.15 with a standard deviation of 0.03.

high standard deviation of 0.39 without outliers. On the other hand, the recall was considerably high, ranging
between 0.95 and 0.98 with a 0.96 average and 0.01 standard deviation with a single outlier at 0.95. Also, the
accuracy results were interestingly high, with an average of 0.97, a standard deviation of 0.01, with the lowest
value being 0.95 and the highest 0.98 and no outliers. The F1-score had a medium average of 0.45, where the
lowest value was near zero (i.e., 0.003), and the maximum value 0.96 with a very high standard deviation of 0.42
and no outliers. The classiication error rate was interestingly promising, with an average of 0.03 and a standard
deviation of 0.01, where the lowest value was 0.02 and the highest 0.05.

4.3  Known Type
In this subsection, the results of testing the proposed architecture on known data are presented and discussed per
dataset.
  When examining the performance of the proposed architecture in detecting known attacks, the results show
high precision for all the attacks included in the four studied datasets, where the average precision was 0.85 for
the IoT-23 dataset, 0.84 for the Bot-IoT dataset, 0.71 for the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset, and 0.76 for the CIC-IDS-2018
dataset. Although those numbers might be considered lower than other proposed models in the literature;
however, the proposed architecture is designed to maximise the recall of detecting unknown attacks, which is
evident by the high recall values across all datasets, ranging between 0.88 and 0.96. More importantly, the average
classiication error rate for known attacks was less than 13% across all four datasets, where the highest value was
20% for the Mirai DDoS attack in the IoT-23 dataset, and the lowest value was around 2% for detecting several
types of attacks in the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset.
  Tables 12, 13, 14, and 15 show the testing results for detecting known attacks using the IoT-23, Bot-IoT, CIC-IDS-
2017, and the CIC-IDS-2018 datasets, respectively. A detailed discussion about the performance on the diferent
datasets is provided next.

the architecture’s strength in ensuring minimal false negatives, a critical aspect in security applications. The
overall accuracy remained robust, airming the model’s general applicability to IoT environments. The variation
in F1-scores across attack types highlights areas for future reinement, particularly in balancing precision and
recall.
4.3.2       Table 13: Performance on Bot-IoT dataset.                            The results in Table 13 showcase the architecture’s performance
on the Bot-IoT dataset, underscoring a consistently high precision and recall. This dataset, rich in botnet attack
data, demonstrates the architecture’s adeptness at handling voluminous and varied attack simulations. Notably,
the high accuracy across diferent attack simulations relects the model’s robustness and its potential for practical
security solutions in IoT settings. The lower classiication error rates further validate the model’s eicacy,
suggesting it as a viable tool for detecting known and unknown botnet-related activities.

4.3.3 Table 14: Performance on CIC-IDS-2017 dataset. Table 14 details the model’s evaluation against the CIC-IDS-
2017 dataset, highlighting its performance in a more traditional network setting. The data reveals a challenge in
achieving high precision for certain rare attack types, indicating potential overitting or a lack of generalizability
in those cases. However, the consistently high recall rates underscore the model’s sensitivity to attack detection,
a paramount feature for IDS. This performance points to the necessity for further model tuning to improve
precision without compromising on recall, ensuring balanced performance across all attack categories.

4.3.4 Table 15: Performance on CIC-IDS-2018 dataset. Finally, Table 15 examines the architecture’s application to
the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset, emphasizing its performance in detecting a broad spectrum of attack types within
contemporary network environments. Similar to the CIC-IDS-2017 results, we observe challenges in precision for
low-frequency attack types, suggesting areas for model enhancement. Nevertheless, the high recall rates across
the board reairm the model’s utility in minimizing false negatives. The accuracy metrics across various attack
types attest to the architecture’s overall efectiveness and its suitability for modern network intrusion detection
scenarios.

4.4  Benign Type
In this subsection, the results of testing the proposed architecture on benign data are presented and discussed per
dataset.
  Given that the proposed architecture considers all traic as malicious unless proven otherwise, its performance
in distinguishing benign traic from the malicious one is as important as its ability to detect unknown attacks.
The proposed architecture showed signiicant ability to detect benign traic with an average precision between
0.86 and 0.98 across all four datasets with a single outlier at 0.48 using the IoT-23 dataset. Moreover, the recall
value was also considerably high, ranging between 0.90 and 0.93 with no outliers across all datasets. Therefore,
the F1-score was notably signiicant at an average between 0.88 and 0.95, with a single outlier at 0.60 using
the IoT-23 dataset. The classiication error rate across all the datasets was at an acceptable low rate, where the
maximum value was at 20% when trying to detect C&C Mirai attacks using the IoT-23 dataset. However, the
average classiication error rate across ranged between 0.08 and 0.11.
  Tables 16, 17, 18, and 19 show the testing results for detecting benign traic using the IoT-23, Bot-IoT, CIC-IDS-
2017, and the CIC-IDS-2018 datasets, respectively.

4.5  Overall Model Performance
In this subsection, we evaluate the key performance indicators to show the possible cases of wrong and cor-
rect classiication. The overall results of testing the proposed architecture are presented and discussed per
dataset. Moreover, the proposed architecture is compared to the other models in the literature in terms of error
generalisation metrics.
  When considering the overall average performance of the proposed architecture, it was clear that it has a
high accuracy and recall value than precision and F1-score, whereas the classiication error rate was consistently
meagre. The overall average accuracy and the recall for all datasets ranged between 0.88 and 0.95, while the
precision ranged between 0.62 and 0.84, and the F1-score between 0.64 and 0.87. The performance of the proposed
architecture in terms of classiication error rate is considered extremely good, where it is averaged between 0.05
and 0.12. Table 20 shows the average overall performance of the proposed architecture across all datasets and
traic type (i.e., benign, known and unknown).
  Most importantly, when considering only the unknown attacks, the overall average performance of the
proposed architecture shows good recall and accuracy measures (i.e., 0.92), with an excellent classiication error
rate (i.e., 0.08) across all datasets. Conversely, the precision and F1-score were moderate, 0.4 and 0.44, respectively.

Table 21 shows the average overall performance of the proposed architecture in detecting unknown attacks
across all datasets.
   When comparing the proposed architecture in detecting unknown attacks to those proposed in the literature,
it shows signiicant improvement in terms of accuracy, recall and classiication error rate, as shown in Table
22. It is important to note that since our proposed architecture operates by completely removing entire classes
and subclasses from the training set and reintroducing them in the testing set to simulate unknown attacks,
comparing our results with other approaches that do not adopt the same methodology for deining unknown
attacks would be inappropriate. Such a comparison would be analogous to comparing apples and oranges.

5      Discussion
In this section, the performance and real-world applications of the proposed architecture are presented and
discussed. It is well-established that the time required to detect cyberattacks directly inluences the average cost
of an attack. According to IBM’s 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report, the mean time to identify and contain (MTTI

and MTTC) a cyber data breach reached a seven-year low, attributed to the increased adoption of AI systems.
For instance, the use of AI in detection reduced the average cost of a data breach by 32.98%, from $5.7 million
to $3.82 million. Furthermore, the MTTI and MTTC decreased by 33.77%, from 308 days to 204 days, when AI
systems were employed. These indings underscore the critical role of early detection techniques leveraging AI
in mitigating the inancial impact of cyberattacks, particularly when addressing unknown attacks. This further
emphasizes the signiicance of the proposed architecture.

5.1  Complexity Analysis and Strategic Dataset Selection
To analyze the complexity of our proposed zero-trust IDS architecture, we consider both space and time com-
plexities, which are crucial for understanding its scalability and performance in real-world scenarios. The space
complexity of our architecture is primarily inluenced by the size of the datasets used for training and the
complexity of the machine learning models deployed. Speciically, the deep learning models and the unsupervised
clustering algorithm (DBSCAN) require memory proportional to the size of the input data and the number of
parameters in the models.
  The time complexity is determined by the computational cost of training and running the machine learning
models across multiple stages and layers. The training phase of deep learning models involves iterative back-
propagation, which has a time complexity of � (� · � · �), where � is the number of samples, � is the number of
features, and � is the number of iterations. The DBSCAN algorithm, used in the unsupervised stage, has a time
complexity of � (�2) in the worst case, but optimizations can reduce it to � (� log�) for many datasets.
  In practical terms, the architecture’s performance and scalability will depend on the speciic hardware and
software environment, the eiciency of the implementations, and the complexity of the network traic being
analyzed. Future work will include detailed empirical evaluations to quantify the architecture’s space and time
requirements under various conditions, aiming to optimize both for eicient deployment in diverse network
settings.
  Further, our research speciically targets the detection of unknown attacks in IoT and traditional networks,
guiding our choice of datasets to align with this focus. While some other well-known datasets such as the Ton
dataset1 is valuable, it was not included because we aimed to address unique challenges posed by unknown
attacks. This strategic selection ensures that our study remains concentrated on emerging threats, demonstrating
the efectiveness of our architecture in varied network environments.

5.2  Practical Implementation and Real-World Applicability
In a real-world scenario, the proposed architecture could be deployed in a smart manufacturing facility with
interconnected IoT devices and traditional networks. The system would be integrated at critical points, such
as IoT gateways and network routers, to monitor incoming and outgoing traic. Traic data would undergo
preprocessing, and the supervised models would be trained on known attack patterns, while unsupervised
clustering techniques would identify deviations indicative of unknown attacks. The system would enforce a zero
trust policy, lagging all traic as malicious unless proven otherwise, ensuring a comprehensive security posture.
  The deployment beneits include enhanced detection of unknown type-A and type-B attacks, scalability
across diverse network environments, and reduced false positives due to the multi-layer iltering approach.
By continuously updating the supervised models with new attack patterns, the system ensures adaptability to
evolving threats, providing robust network security and improving the detection capabilities of IoT and traditional
networks alike.
  Last, in large-scale enterprise deployments, ensuring continuous performance and accuracy of the proposed
architecture requires adaptive learning mechanisms, periodic model retraining with updated datasets, and
dynamic tuning of unsupervised components like DBSCAN. A feedback loop to incorporate newly detected
anomalies into the training data enhances adaptability to evolving threats. To address network topology changes
and dynamic environments, the architecture can leverage software-deined networking (SDN) for lexible traic
management, while automated monitoring and real-time anomaly detection ensure resilience against emerging
attack techniques. Regular audits and simulations further validate its robustness in operational settings.

6   Conclusion
Unknown attacks have been ranking in the top three attack types since 2014, remaining an open research issue
to be solved. This research work addressed the issue of detecting unknown attacks by proposing and evaluating a
multi-stage multi-layer zero trust architecture for detecting unknown attacks. It assumes all traic is malicious
unless proven otherwise; thus, zero-trust. It simulates a multi-layer iltering funnel, where traic passes through
multiple ilters designed to take advantage of the concept of type-A and type-B unknown attacks. Malicious
traic is identiied using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. The overall
performance results showed signiicant improvement in the accuracy, recall and error classiication rate in
detecting unknown attacks.
  As our work considers all traic malicious unless proven otherwise, our future work will focus on empirically
testing our ZTA against real-world IoT traic and botnet attack simulations. This approach will help us validate
the eiciency of our model in practical scenarios, ensuring it is capable of handling high traic volumes and
diverse cyber threats.
